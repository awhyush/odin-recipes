    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dosas are a thin, savory crepe-like Indian pancake traditionally eaten for breakfast, but I like them anytime. These may not be very authentic, but they are a tasty alternative that appeals to the typical American pancake.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup brown rice flour</li>
        <li>½ cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir the brown rice and whole wheat flours together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the water to make a thin batter. Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, sugar, turmeric, cumin, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, coriander, ginger, cayenne pepper and rice vinegar until evenly blended. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour, or overnight.</li>
        <li>To cook the dosas, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, spreading it over the bottom in a thin layer. Cook 1 minute, turn, and cook 1 minute more. Remove from the pan. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
